            ESCT (Employee Self Care Team) is an initiative designed to provide timely and transparent financial support to government employees and pensioners in times of need. Our core mission is to foster a community built on compassion, ensuring that help is always available to those who have dedicated their service.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Through a structured and verified system, we facilitate donations for specific claim categories like **Retirement**, **Death After Service**, and **Death During Service**. Every action on our platform, from user registration to beneficiary claims, is subject to a rigorous verification process to maintain the integrity and trust of our community.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            We believe that a small, consistent contribution can make a monumental difference. Our platform empowers members to easily contribute to their peers and see the direct impact of their support, making compassion a simple, tangible action.
